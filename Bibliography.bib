  	This study is \emph{very} similar to mine in many ways, especially how the test the third-person view building a similar rig as I plan to build. It does not however focus on the performance differences between gamers and non-gamers

  	Even though this is a very old article about games I still think it is very relevant. It talks about different perspective in games and the benefits from each some thing that is very interesting since the 1990:s where when graphics in computer games grew more and more powerful.

  	In my early experiments building the rig I've notice a very disturbing outer-body-experience that is hard to put into words. Even though I can see my own limbs it is very hard to understand that the limbs I see are my own. When reading this article on VR and AR I noticed they described this very well.

 	There are some very interesting parts in this article, but the most useful is probably the result; \verb;``; This result indicates that the significant underperception of distance observed in several studies on distance perception in virtual environments is not caused by the limited field of view of the head-mounted display \verb;``;. This means that it shouldn't really matter what quality and FOV the video glasses I use for the study. Of course this is something that needs to be tested.

	There are some interesting parts in this (Swedish) book that basically says that when a reader is reading a book it doesn't matter if its written in first-person or in third-person, the reader quickly adapts. This means that in writing there isn't really a significant difference between the two writing types, at least not for the reader.

  	This study also focuses on some differences between gamers and non-gamers but it doesn't (at least not to my understanding) focus on trying this out. It is more based on surveys than hands on testing. I should say that I have not yet read the whole article since it's so long.
