\section{Introduction}
% Description of what third-person view is
% My hypotheses 


There is a constantly ongoing debate,~\cite{valadez2012just},~\cite{tear2014video} and~\cite{ferguson2015hitman}, about whether playing video games produce negative side-effects, such as increased moral sensitivity~\cite{grizzard2014being}, or not. On the contrary, some research show that video games can result in \emph{positive} side-effects such as improved cognitive control, emotional regulation, spatial resolution of vision, hand-eye motor coordination, and contrast sensitivity~\cite{gong2015enhanced}.

Studies in writing have previously shown that most readers do not have any recognition about whether a book they have read was written in first- or third-person~\cite{hagg2012nya}. This suggest, together with experiments showing that humans quickly adjust to seeing everything upside-down~\cite{kohler1962goggles}, that users could get used to seeing themselves from third-person perspective.

This study aims to investigate if there is a measurable difference in performance, such as number of errors made and time consumption, between people who have played games and people who have not when they are prompted to complete everyday-like tasks viewed from third-person perspective (see Fig~\ref{fig:GTAIV}). Similar studies have been conducted, such as~\cite{schmierbach2011exploring} and~\cite{nakamura20103pi}, but certain aspects about performance differences in everyday tasks remain unaddressed. The study was completed using a custom-made rig consisting of a camera, video goggles, carbon fiber booms, 3D-printed parts, batteries and cables, see Fig~\ref{fig:RigDesign}.

\section{Material \& Method}
Studies prior to this one have been done on the differences between gamers and non-gamers, such as~\cite{schmierbach2011exploring} and~\cite{gong2015enhanced}, but none using hardware to simulate the outer-body, third-person view experienced in games (see Fig~\ref{fig:GTAIV}) in real life. Our method of choice was to construct a custom designed rig where subjects saw themselves, in real-time from a third-person perspective. In order to see the differences between gamers and non-gamers the test subjects had to complete the same three tasks, in three different configurations, three times in a row. After the subjects finished their participation, they were prompted to fill in a form regarding the experience and their prior experience with video games. The two groups, consisting of 12 subjects (8 in each group, male subjects only), were then benchmarked against each other to see which performed better. In the following subsections we will thoroughly demonstrate the different steps in our method and the tasks needed to later concretize credible results.

   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ExternalMaterial/GTA}

\end{figure}









\subsection{Task Design} \label{subsec:TaskDesign}

In order to get the required measurements with high credibility the tasks performed by the test subjects were carefully planed, pilot-tested, prepared, executed and then evaluated. To get as general spread results as possible 3 different types of tasks had to be completed by each test subject.

\subsubsection{Accuracy Task}

The test subjects rolled, threw or bounced (depending on their preference) a multi-colored volleyball in order to try and hit a target (a regular sized chair) placed approximately 5 meters away to successfully complete the task. If the test subject missed the target they were told to try again until the finally hit the target. This test measured the participants precise accuracy and ball control through the number of tries required in order to hit the target.

\subsubsection{Balance Task}

The test subjects walked, in their normal walking speed, on a thin straight line, measured at 10 meters long, placed on the ground for as far as he/she can. This test measured the participants balance skills through the distance covered before stepping outside the line.

\subsubsection{Movement Task}

The test subjects walked, facing forward, in their normal walking speed, thorough a pre-planned course approximately 25 meters long and circa 2 meters wide (see Fig~\ref{fig:Course}) without touching anything other than the floor. The course was constructed using 40 chairs, 5 tables, 1 large wooden box, 5 meter long wall and a tall pillar(see Fig~\ref{fig:CourseTop}). Participants started between two chairs on the right and finished when they stepped on the cross marked with tape on the floor. This test measured the participants movement and navigational skills through the required time in order to complete the task. Errors made, such as touching the chairs or tables, were also recorded.

\end{figure}

%\begin{description}
   %\item[Accuracy Task] The test subjects rolled a ball in order to try and hit a target placed 10 meters away to successfully complete the task. This test measured the participants precise accuracy and ball control through the number of tries required in order to hit the target.
   %\item[Balance Task] The test subjects walked, in their normal walking speed, on a thin straight line, measured at 10 meters long, placed on the ground for as far as he/she can. This test measured the participants balance skills through the distance covered before stepping outside the line.
   %\item[Movement Task] The test subjects walked, facing forward, in their normal walking speed, thorough a pre-planned course around 30 meters long, on flat ground marked with cones. This test measured the participants movement skills through the required time in order to complete the task.
%\end{description}

%\subsubsection{Configurations}
Each task was performed \emph{3 times} by each participant, in 3 different configurations resulting in a total of nine results for each participant. The different configurations were completed in the following order:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Wearing the rig, video goggles \emph{off}.
	\item Wearing the rig, video goggles \emph{on}, viewed from \emph{first-person} camera
	\item Wearing the rig, video goggles \emph{on}, viewed from \emph{third-person} camera
\end{enumerate} 

Completing the task 3 times was done to get an accurate estimate of each of the participants performance. Completing the task in 3 different configurations was done to minimize the effects of individual differences amongst the test subjects. 

The first configuration served as a baseline for how a participant performs when completing the task ``normally''. The second configuration was used to compare against the first configuration in order to understand how much the video goggles and the first-person camera affected the participants performance in completing the tasks. Comparing the third configuration and the second configuration was the main focus of this study which was why the third configuration was the most critical one.










\subsection{Rig Design}
In order to simulate a game-like, out-of-body experience and a third-person perspective (see Fig~\ref{fig:GTAIV}), without leaving the participants nauseated\footnote{Early test showed that participants felt sea-sick due to unwanted camera movement created by an unstable test-rig.} the rig had to be as rigid as possible. The main parts in the rig were:
\begin{description}
	\item[Back Mount] A solid mounting foundation was constructed out of light weight and stiff materials such as carbon fiber, ABS- and polymorph plastic. As a base for the whole construction a snowboard back protector was used in order to connect the carbon fiber rods to the subjects back. Some 3D-printed parts where used to fasten the third-person camera to the subject.

	\item[Third-Person Video Camera] The video camera used for the third-person view, constantly generating a live video stream, was mounted circa a meter approximately 45 degrees above/behind the participants head and slightly tilted downwards in order to frame the video correctly. Since a large field-of-view, a compact- and lightweight design are the most important requirements for selecting the video camera a \emph{GoPro Hero 3: Black Edition}\footnote{More info can be found at http://www.prisjakt.nu/produkt.php?e=1457108} was chosen, weighing 163 grams and a field-of-view at 170 degrees. The camera was connected to the participants video goggles using a 3 meter long, 4 pole, cable.

	\item[Video Goggles \&\ First-Person Video Camera] To cover the subjects eyes and view the live video stream a pair of specially designed video goggles were used. These goggles, a pair of \emph{SkyZone SKY-01 V2}\footnote{More info can be found at http://www.foxtechfpv.com/skyzone-fpv-gogglesmatte-blackpreorder-p-1218.html}, have a field-of-view of approximately 30 degrees and a built in camera with a diagonal field-of-view at 120 degrees. This camera was used for the second step in each task, described in Section~\ref{subsec:TaskDesign}, to simulate first-person perspective.
\end{description}
The final result of what the rig looks like when put together correctly can be found in Fig~\ref{fig:RigDesign}.

   \caption{A detailed overview of different parts of the rig. \label{fig:RigDesign}}
\end{figure}










\subsection{Survey Design}
After each test subject finishes his/hers precipitation in the experiment they where prompted to fill in a form regarding the experience and their prior experience with video games. The survey included the following seven questions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Do you consider yourself a \emph{gamer}?
	\item What was the hardest parts about the experiment?
	\item On an average, how many hours per week do you spend playing video games?
	\item How many years have you been playing video games?
	\item In total, how many hours have you spent playing a game viewed from a third-person perspective?
	\item If any, please name some of these third-person games you have played.
	\item Did you find this experiment fun?
\end{enumerate}
Each test subject also fills in details about name, age and sex so the results from the test data can be paired up with the survey. The details where later removed in the results in order to protect the test subjects anonymity.
