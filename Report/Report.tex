\begin{abstract}
The concept of third-person perspective in gaming has been around since the start of graphics in video games and so has the dispute about negative effects from violent games. This study aims to investigate if there is a measurable difference in performance between gamers and non-gamers when they complete the same tasks from a third-person perspective. Experiments were made using a back-mounted camera rig and pair of video goggles. Results, generated from the a small amount of participants, suggest that there is no significant difference in performance between the two groups when adapting to third-person view.

\section{Introduction}
% Description of what third-person view is


There is a constantly ongoing debate of whether playing video games produce negative side-effects or not~\cite{tear2014video}. Some earlier findings indicate that committing ``immoral'' virtual behaviors in a video game can lead to increased moral sensitivity of the player~\cite{grizzard2014being}. Others studies point towards that playing video games do not have any effect on depression, hostility, or visuospatial cognition~\cite{valadez2012just}. There are even results in experiments that suggest the opposite; violent games reduce depression and hostile feelings in players through mood management~\cite{ferguson2015hitman}. 

On the contrary, some research hint that video games can result in \emph{positive} side-effects such as improved cognitive control, emotional regulation, spatial resolution of vision, hand-eye motor coordination, and contrast sensitivity~\cite{gong2015enhanced}. Other results point towards an improved probabilistic inference without loss of measurable accuracy~\cite{green2010improved}.

Studies in literature have previously shown that most readers do not have any recognition about whether a book they have read was written in first- or third-person~\cite{hagg2012nya} due to humans capability of ``translating'' and adapting from one pronouns to another. Kohler's experiments with inverted vision goggles showed subjects walking and riding bicycles while seeing upside-down~\cite{kohler1962goggles}, pointing towards even greater capability of the human brains ability to adapt. This could suggest that users might be able to adapt to seeing themselves from third-person perspective.

This study aims to investigate if there is a measurable difference in performance, such as number of errors made and time consumption, between people who have played games and people who have not when they are prompted to complete everyday-like tasks viewed from third-person perspective (see Fig~\ref{fig:GTAIV}). Similar studies have been conducted, such as~\cite{schmierbach2011exploring} and~\cite{nakamura20103pi}, but certain aspects about performance differences in everyday tasks remain unaddressed. The study was completed using a custom-made rig in order to fully simulate the experience of a life viewed from a third-person perspective.

\section{Material \& Method}
Studies prior to this one have been done on the differences between gamers and non-gamers, such as~\cite{schmierbach2011exploring} and~\cite{gong2015enhanced}, but none using hardware to simulate the out-of-body, third-person view experienced in games (see Fig~\ref{fig:GTAIV}) in real life. Our method of choice was to construct a custom designed rig where subjects saw themselves, in real-time from a third-person perspective. In order to see the differences between gamers and non-gamers the test subjects had to complete the same three tasks, in three different configurations, three times in a row. After the subjects finished their participation, they were prompted to fill in a form regarding the experience and their prior experience with video games. The two groups, consisting of 13\footnote{14 subjects were originally in the study, but one male could not complete the whole experiment due to the his poor eyesight when not wearing his glasses. He was therefore excluded from the study after the first task and not included int the results.} subjects (undergraduate volunteers, high male skew\footnote{12 male subjects and 2 female, in ages ranging from 23 to 28}), were then benchmarked against each other to see which performed better. In the following subsections we will thoroughly demonstrate the different steps in our method and the tasks needed to later concretize credible results.

\end{figure}




\subsection{Task Design} \label{subsec:TaskDesign}

In order to get the required measurements with high credibility the tasks performed by the test subjects were carefully planed, pilot-tested, prepared, executed and then evaluated. To get as general spread results as possible 3 different types of tasks had to be completed by each test subject.

\subsubsection{Task 1: Accuracy}

The test subjects rolled, threw or bounced (depending on their preference) a multi-colored volleyball in order to try and hit a target (a regular sized chair) placed approximately 5 meters away to successfully complete the task (see Fig~\ref{fig:AccuracyTask}). If the test subject missed the target they were told to try again until the finally hit the target. This test measured the participants precise accuracy and ball control through the number of tries required in order to hit the target.

   \caption{A \emph{side-view} of the course used during Accuracy Task where green is tape on the floor and blue is the chair.}. \label{fig:AccuracyTask}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Task 2: Balance}

The test subjects walked, in their preferred speed, on a thin straight line made out of tape, measured at 10 meters long (see Fig~\ref{fig:BalanceTask}), placed on the ground. This test measured the participants balance skills through the number of errors they made. These errors were objectively measured and recorded using one pre-defined rule; if any part of the shoe/foot covered the width of the tape (approximately 2 centimeters wide) it was considered to be a legal foot placement, everything else was illegal. An example of an illegal foot placement can be found in Fig~\ref{fig:Illegal} and a legal example can be found in Fig~\ref{fig:Legal}.

   \caption{An approximate \emph{top-view} of the curse used during the Balance Task where green is tape on the floor.} \label{fig:BalanceTask}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Task 3: Movement}

The test subjects walked, facing forward, in their normal walking speed, thorough a pre-planned course approximately 25 meters long and circa 2 meters wide (see Fig~\ref{fig:Course}) without touching anything other than the floor. The course was constructed using 40 chairs, 5 tables, 1 large wooden box, 5 meter long wall and a tall pillar(see Fig~\ref{fig:CourseTop}). Participants started between two chairs on the right and finished when they stepped on the cross marked with tape on the floor. This test measured the participants movement and navigational skills through the required time in order to complete the task. Errors made, such as touching the chairs or tables, were also recorded.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Configurations} \label{subsubsec:Configurations}
Each task was performed \emph{3 times} by each participant, in 3 different configurations resulting in a total of nine results for each participant. The different configurations were completed in the following order:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Off}: \emph{Not} wearing the rig, video goggles \emph{off}.
	\item \textbf{First-Person}: Wearing the rig, video goggles \emph{on}, viewed from \emph{first-person} camera.
	\item \textbf{Third-Person}: Wearing the rig, video goggles \emph{on}, viewed from \emph{third-person} camera.
\end{enumerate} 

Completing the task 3 times was done to get an accurate estimate of each of the participants performance. Completing the task in 3 different configurations was done to minimize the effects of individual differences amongst the test subjects. 

The first configuration served as a baseline for how a participant performs when completing the task ``normally''. The second configuration was used to compare against the first configuration in order to understand how much the video goggles and the first-person camera affected the participants performance in completing the tasks. Comparing the third configuration and the second configuration was the main focus of this study which was why the third configuration was the most critical one.










\subsection{Rig Design}
In order to simulate a game-like, out-of-body experience and a third-person perspective (see Fig~\ref{fig:GTAIV}), without leaving the participants nauseated\footnote{Early test showed that participants felt sea-sick due to unwanted camera movement created by an unstable test-rig.} the rig had to be as rigid as possible. The main parts in the rig were:
\begin{description}
	\item[Back \&\ Camera Mount] A solid mounting foundation was constructed out of light weight and stiff materials such as carbon fiber, ABS and polymorph plastic. As a base for the whole construction a snowboard back protector was used in order to connect the carbon fiber rods to the subjects back. Some 3D-printed parts where used to fasten the third-person camera to the subject.

	\item[Third-Person Video Camera] The video camera used for the third-person view, constantly generating a live video stream, was mounted on a pole circa a meter approximately 45 degrees above/behind the participants head and tilted circa 30 degrees downwards in order to frame the video correctly. Since a large field-of-view, a compact- and lightweight design are the most important requirements for selecting the video camera a \emph{GoPro Hero 3: Black Edition}\footnote{More info can be found at http://www.prisjakt.nu/produkt.php?e=1457108} was chosen, weighing 163 grams and a field-of-view at 170 degrees. The camera was connected to the participants video goggles using a 3 meter long, 4 pole and a cable.

	\item[Video Goggles \&\ First-Person Video Camera] To cover the subjects eyes and view the live video stream a pair of specially designed video goggles were used. These goggles, a pair of \emph{SkyZone SKY-01 V2}\footnote{More info can be found at http://www.foxtechfpv.com/skyzone-fpv-gogglesmatte-blackpreorder-p-1218.html}, have a field-of-view of approximately 30 degrees and a built in camera with a diagonal field-of-view at 120 degrees. This camera was used for the second configuration for each task (described in Section~\ref{subsubsec:Configurations}) to simulate first-person perspective.
\end{description}
The final result of the rigs design is somewhat inspired by~\cite{salamin2010quantifying} (but with more up-to-date hardware) and can be found in Fig~\ref{fig:RigDesign} along with what the user saw\footnote{The top and bottom of the image is cut of due to the camera not being able to capture non-wide screen video. During the experiment the user was able to see approximately 30 centimeters behind his/hers feet.} in Fig~\ref{fig:3Pview}.

   \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ExternalMaterial/Rig}
   \caption{A detailed overview of different parts of the rig. \label{fig:RigDesign}}
\end{figure}







\subsection{Survey Design}
After each test subject finished his/hers participation in the experiment they were prompted to fill out a survey (the full form can be found in the Appendix in Section~\ref{subsec:Survey}) regarding the experience during the experiment and their prior experience with video games. The survey included the following seven questions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Do you consider yourself a \emph{gamer}?
	\item What was the hardest parts in the experiment?
	\item On average, how many hours per week do you spend playing video games?
	\item How many years have you been playing video games?
	\item In total, how many hours have you spent playing a game viewed from a third-person perspective?
	\item If any, please name some of these third-person games you have played.
	\item Did you find your participation in this experiment fun?
\end{enumerate}
Each test subject also filled in details about their name, age and sex so the results from the test data could be paired up with the surveys. The details were later removed in the results in order to protect the test subjects anonymity.

\section{Results}
Earlier work suggest that third-person perspective causes no significant discomfort while at the same time having a short learning time~\cite{nakamura20103pi}, something we found contradictory to our results. Participants generally performed noticeably worse when executing all tasks in the second, first-person, configuration compared to the first, normal viewing, configuration. Subjects normally preformed even worse in the third, third-person, configuration, somewhat rejecting earlier suggestions. 

Findings amongst non-gamers suggest that there is no significant measurable difference in performance between the sexes for any of the tasks in any configuration.





\subsection{Group Classification}
Before comparing the results we classified each participant into one of the two groups, either the subject was a \emph{gamer} or a \emph{non-gamer}. From the results in the survey 6 participants classified themselves as gamers while the rest as non-gamers. Whilst each subjects own opinion counts, the classification needed to be objective. In order to be regarded as a gamer the subject had to fulfill 4 requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item An average of 5 hours or more spent playing games every week. 
	\item A total of more than 80 hours playtime in a third-person game.
	\item 7 years or more of experience playing video games.
	\item Listing at least 3 third-person games they have played.
\end{enumerate}
Using this objective classification, 5 subjects, where 4 considered themselves as gamers, meet the criteria. The two subjects that also considered themselves as gamers that did not fulfill the criteria were, along with the rest, considered as \emph{non-gamers}.





\subsection{Tasks}
Results when comparing the two groups, gamers and non-gamers, in each of the executed tasks in the experiment.


\subsubsection{Accuracy Task}
As seen in Table~\ref{tab:Task1GraphP} the average performance, as in number of tries required in order to hit the target, for both groups is generally good (as in a low number of tries) with a standard deviation stretching from as low as 0.2 to 1.2 at most. Whilst the average gamer generally performed slightly better in both first- and third-person configurations, there is no significant notable difference between the two groups.


Furthermore, looking at the graph in Fig~\ref{fig:Task1GraphD} we see that the percental average individual difference in performance is generally lower for gamers. This indicates that the average gamer had less trouble with readjustment when changing between the different configurations. This result was rejected after a T-test was performed on the datasets showing no significant difference between the two-groups.

\end{figure}












\subsubsection{Balance Task}
Unlike the results from task 1, on an average, a gamer performed slightly \emph{worse} than a non-gamer in the third-person configuration. As seen in Table~\ref{tab:Task2GraphP} the only notable difference between the groups is the the last configuration. Noteworthy is also the fact that none of the participants, in any of the groups, made any illegal foot placements during the first configuration (not wearing the any equipment) suggesting that the task might have been too straightforward. At the same time the numbers of illegal steps dramatically increased when viewed from third-person view, from 0 to 9.7 respectively 12.3 steps.  

When turning our attention towards the percental average individual difference in performance presented in Fig~\ref{fig:Task2GraphD} we could only conclude that the average gamer had less difficulty with readjustment when changing between the last two configurations \footnote{Although the standard deviation was generally high at approximately 528.6\% amongst non-gamers, respectively 160.2\% between gamers}. This result was also rejected after a T-test was performed on the datasets showing no significant difference between the two-groups.

\end{figure}













\subsubsection{Movement Task}
Similarly to the findings in the balance task, results in the movement task (found in Table~\ref{tab:Task3GraphP}) suggest that the average gamer performs worse, as in more time required to complete the course, than the average non-gamer. 

Whilst average performance among the two groups is interesting, it is irrelevant for this task in particular. This might be due to the individual differences, such as having a lower normal walking speed or being more cautious when completing the course. However, if we turn our attention towards Fig~\ref{fig:Task3GraphD} we can see that the percental average individual difference in performance is generally higher for the average gamer than the average non-gamer. Unlike in the two earlier tasks this hypothesis was confirmed when performing a T-test on the two different groups with a resulting T-score at approximately 0.02, after confirming that both datasets are normally distributed.

While this might look like a significant find, it is hard to prove that this is not due to pure luck induced by the rather low number of participants in the study.

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:Discussion}

Since the low amount of participants in the study influence the results, no final conclusions can be made about the difference in performance between third-person view and normal viewing when comparing gamers and non-gamers. However, unintentional findings where made during the experiments, these include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item All 13 participants in the study said they found the third-person view, configuration 3, the hardest while only 5 found the second configuration, first-person view, hard.

	\item Walking on a straight line on the floor (as participants where promoted to in task 2) while in configuration 3, third-person view, was exceptionally hard regardless to the subjects background and sex. This was due to the lack of vision of the line in front of the participants feet and body while walking. 

	\item What defines a \emph{gamer} is more of a subjective opinion than an objective classification.

	\item Familiarizing participants with the concept of moving their vision using their hips rather than their neck turned out to take more time than first anticipated. Even after 15 minutes of wearing the rig in third-person perspective participants were moving their neck instead of their hips.

	\item Depth perception is generally hard when viewing a camera stream from a wide field-of-view camera lens, especially when removing stereoscopic vision.

	\item Although most participants felt slightly nauseated after the experiment, none lost complete balance and fell. As a plus, all participants said they enjoyed taking part in the experience.
\end{itemize}





\subsection{Limitations and Drawbacks}
Due to the time and budget limit there are several ways to improve upon our experiments. The largest, and possibly most significant, is the low amount of participants in the study. Other limitations and drawbacks include:
\begin{description}
	\item[Rig Design] Although the rig was rigid enough for this particular experiment, reinforcements should be made in order to continue with further testing. The biggest drawback of the current rig are the shakes generated on fast and hefty movements such as running or fast turns. This could be fixed by connecting one, or preferably two, more booms on an angle to both the back mount and the current booms to counteract horizontal and vertical vibrations. Another solution could also be to purchase an already tested and viable rig such as the \emph{3rdPersonView}\footnote{More info can be found at http://www.sailvideosystem.com/p/3rdpersonview-all-sports-pro-166682} from \emph{Sail Video System}.

	\item[Camera Movement] Normally in a virtual third-person game, such as GTA (see Fig~\ref{fig:GTAIV}), the ``camera'' follows the characters movements with a slight delay in order to get more fluid camera movements. The current setup does not currently support this due to the cameras fixed attachment to the back mount, however this could be corrected using a 3-axis gimbal, something that would also improve the overall stability of the camera.

	\item[Task Design] The tests chosen for this study, especially the task 1 and 2, aimed to test specific abilities, such as accuracy, balance and navigation. While this is a start, more relevant and less specific test could be conducted using more everyday-like tasks, such as \emph{riding a bike}, \emph{walking to work}, \emph{cooking food} etc.

	\item[Video Goggles] Whilst the video goggles used have an average resolution, more sophisticated video goggles, such as the \emph{Oculus Rift}\footnote{More info can be found at http://www.sailvideosystem.com/p/3rdpersonview-all-sports-pro-166682} or the \emph{HTC Vive}\footnote{More info can be found at http://www.htcvr.com/}, with a higher pixel count could be used to create a more immerse and believable simulation. Since both of these are made for virtual reality (VR for short) gaming, their field-of-view is notably greater than in the \emph{SkyZone} goggles used. Using an actual VR headset would also add stereoscopic vision, a feature that might have made a difference on our results.

	\item[More Segregated Groups] As discussed earlier in Section~\ref{sec:Discussion}, the definition of \emph{what defines a gamer} is not apparent. Since none of the student volunteers were professional, full-time gamers we cannot make any statements about \emph{actual gamers}\footnote{A person who spends most of their awake time playing games, mostly professionally but also casually}. The same goes for non-gamers; most of our subjects have sometime in their life been exposed to video games to some extent, either playing themselves or watching someone else playing. This results in oblique findings about non-gamers as well.

	\item[Sex Ratio] Due to the high male skew in the study (especially amongst gamers), no conclusive findings about difference, or indifference, between males and females were found. This should not necessarily be recognized as a direct drawback, but could perhaps serve as a guide for further testing.
\end{description}




\subsection{Conclusion}
We believe this study should serve as a foundation and a guide for further research in the future and not as reference material for any hard proof. In order to fully study the differences between the groups one would need a larger participant group of at least 100 subjects with a greater segregation in time spent playing video games.
