The Hitman study: Violent video game exposure effects on aggressive behavior, hostile feelings, and depression.Ferguson, Christopher J.; Rueda, Stephanie M.[Journal Article]European Psychologist,  Vol 15(2), 2010, 99-108. doi: 10.1027/1016-9040/a000010.

Abstract
This article explores commonly discussed theories of violent video game effects: the social learning, mood management, and catharsis hypotheses. An experimental study was carried out to examine violent video game effects. In this study, 103 young adults were given a frustration task and then randomized to play no game, a nonviolent game, a violent game with good versus evil theme (i.e., playing as a good character taking on evil), or a violent game in which they played as a “bad guy.” Results indicated that randomized video game play had no effect on aggressive behavior; real-life violent video game-playing history, however, was predictive of decreased hostile feelings and decreased depression following the frustration task. Results do not support a link between violent video games and aggressive behavior, but do suggest that violent games reduce depression and hostile feelings in players through mood management.
