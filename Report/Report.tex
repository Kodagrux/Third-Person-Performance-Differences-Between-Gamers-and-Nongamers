\section{Introduction}
The text in this will contain the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What have I done?
	\item Why did I do it?
	\item The background to the subject
	\item What is new in this study
	\item References to earlier work such as~\cite{schmierbach2011exploring},~\cite{salamin2006benefits} and~\cite{nakamura20103pi}
	\item Description of what third-person view is
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
   \item[Purpose] To investigate if there is a measurable difference in performance between people whom have played games and people whom have not.
   \item[Motivation] There is a constantly ongoing debate,~\cite{valadez2012just}, about whether playing video games produce negative side-effects or not. My study investigates one of the possible \emph{positive} performance differences, such as few number of errors and low time consumption.
   \item[Contents] A conclusive investigation of if there is a performance difference of playing video games viewed in third-person or not.
   \item[Resources] The study has been completed using a custom-made rig consisting of a camera, video goggles, carbon fiber booms, 3D-printed parts, batteries and cables. References to earlier work will also be used.
\end{description}


Studies prior to this one have been done on the differences between gamers and non-gamers, such as~\cite{schmierbach2011exploring}, but none using hardware to simulate the third-person view experienced in games (see Figure~\ref{fig:GTAIV}) in real life. 

Studies in writing have previously shown that most readers do not have any recognition about whether a book they have read was written in first- or third-person ~\cite{hagg2012nya}. 






\section{Method}


In the following section we will demonstrate our method and the tasks needed to concretise credible results.

\subsection{Overview}

This section should also contain the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Give an overview/introduction over/to how this study was completed
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What kind of tasks
		\item Rig design
		\item Task design
		\item Performance benchmarking
	\end{itemize}
	\item References to earlier works
	\item Description about things to take into account
	\item Explaining the form every participant has to fill in
\end{itemize}







\subsection{Survey Design}
After each test subject finishes his/hers precipitation in the experiment they where prompted to fill in a form regarding the experience and their prior experience with video games. The survey included the following seven questions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Do you consider yourself a \emph{gamer}?
	\item What was the hardest parts about the experiment?
	\item On an average, how many hours per week do you spend playing video games?
	\item How many years have you been playing video games?
	\item In total, how many hours have you spent playing a game viewed from a third-person perspective?
	\item If any, please name some of these third-person games you have played.
	\item Did you find this experiment fun?
\end{enumerate}
Each test subject also fills in details about name, age and sex so the results from the test data can be paired up with the survey. The details where later removed in the results in order to protect the test subjects anonymity.










\subsection{Task Design}
In order for to get the required measurements with high credibility the tasks performed by the test subjects were carefully planed, prepared and executed. To get as wide spread results as possible a few different types of tasks had to be completed by the test subjects:
\begin{description}
   \item[Accuracy Task] The test subject rolled a ball in order to try and hit a target placed 10 meters away to successfully complete the task. This test measured the participants precise accuracy- and ball control through the number of tries required in order to hit the target.
   \item[Balance Task] The test subject walked, in their normal walking speed, on a thin straight line, measured at 10 meters long, placed flat on the ground for as far as he/she can. This test measured the participants balance skills through the distance covered before stepping outside the line.
   \item[Movement Task] The test subject walks forward facing, in their normal walking speed, thorough a pre-planned course around 30 meters long, on flat ground marked with cones as precise as possible. This test measured the participants movement skills through the required time in order to complete the task.
\end{description}

Each task was performed three times by each participant, in three different configurations resulting in a total of nine results for each participant. The different configurations were completed in the following order:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Wearing the rig, video goggles \emph{off}.
	\item Wearing the rig, video goggles \emph{on}, viewed from \emph{first-person}
	\item Wearing the rig, video goggles \emph{on}, viewed from \emph{third-person}
\end{enumerate}











\subsection{Rig Design}
In order to see the difference in performance a rig was constructed to produce a game-like third person view, see Figure~\ref{fig:GTAIV}. The test-rig consists of three major parts:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Video Camera}: Constantly recording the test subject and generating a live stream.
	\item \textbf{Mount}: Which the camera is mounted upon in order to get the correct angle.
	\item \textbf{Video Goggles}: Covering the test subjects eyes so he/she cannot see anything other than the live video stream from the camera
\end{enumerate}
The final result of what the rig looks like when put together correctly can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:RigDesign}.

\section{Results}
This section will cover the results from the tests that where done and;
\begin{itemize}
	\item The results from the tests
	\item Diagrams comparing the results
	\item Results of earlier work
	\item Compare the performance between the different groups
\end{itemize}





\section{Discussion}
A general discussion about the study such as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What part/conclusion in my study could be biast/not reliable
	\item What does my results mean?
	\item Earlier work, how do they compare to my work and what does that mean?
	\item References to earlier work such as~\cite{schmierbach2011exploring}
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Limitations and Drawbacks}
Due to the time and budget limit there are several ways to improve upon my study, ways of doing this might include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Building a more rigid rig.
	\item Using a more comprehensive camera mounted on a stabilized gimbal.
	\item Using more sophisticated video goggles, such as the Oculus Rift.
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Conclusion}
As a finish, and a complement to the abstract, the conclusion should contain:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What to take out from the study
	\item How this study can be made more in-depth
	\item Future work
\end{itemize}
